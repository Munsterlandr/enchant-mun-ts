# Enchant-mun-ts
Adds some more enchantments to Minecraft.

#### My plans include:

1. Concealing:
A treasure enchant for armor that makes it not appear to other players.

2. Beheading:
Makes mobs with custom heads have a 5% - 25% chance of dropping their head, 5 levels.

3. Curse of Secrecy:
Hides all enchants and curses on the weapon. Never the only curse on loot.

4. Forbidden:
Explodes on use. Curse.
