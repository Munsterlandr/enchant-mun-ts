# Unique enchants
Adds some more enchantments to Minecraft.

#### My plans include:

1. Concealing:
A treasure enchant for armor that makes it not appear to other players.

2. Forbidden:
Explodes on use. Curse.

3. Curse of Secrecy (not finished):
   Hides all enchants and curses on the weapon. Never the only curse on loot.
